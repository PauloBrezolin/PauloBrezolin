## 👨‍💻 About

Software Engineer with **3+ years of experience** building and maintaining production systems. I started early, landed my first role at **17**, completed my degree at **19**, and moved into a **global, English-speaking environment**. I learn fast, deliver with quality, and take ownership from problem definition to production.

I work end-to-end across **systems architecture**, **backend + frontend delivery**, **database design**, **REST API integrations**, **automation**, and **reporting**. My experience spans **education platforms** (120+ schools, 30,000+ students), **logistics & foreign trade systems** with fiscal/government integrations, and **automotive R&D tooling** for test standardization and internal automation.

**Primary languages:** Python, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js; familiar with Java).  
Open to remote and international opportunities in Full Stack, Backend, Automation, Applied AI, and related roles.
